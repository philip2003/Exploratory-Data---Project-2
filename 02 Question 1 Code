# You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. 
# For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. 
# Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.

# Question 1:
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
# Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources 
# for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

# Code:

NEI_sampling <- NEI[sample(nrow(NEI), size=2000, replace=F), ]
Emissions <- aggregate(NEI[, 'Emissions'], by=list(NEI$year), FUN=sum)
Emissions$PM <- round(Emissions[,2]/1000,2)
